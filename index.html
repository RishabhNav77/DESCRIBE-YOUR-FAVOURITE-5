    <h1>Synopsis:</h1>
    In a Canadian forest, lost in a middle of the jungle and on a top of the food chain, there is a small cabin in which a forest ranger was lives early. After he leaves his cabin, a grizzly bear (localized as Grizzy) comes to live in it but he is not alone! a group of number of lemmings also comes with him. There are many facilities in the cabin. There is also a road crossed the forest on which vehicles keep running. The nutty hill on which the cabin is situated are very mysterious, as sometimes magical objects are found. When any magical thing or scientific machine is found from one of these dens or on the road (that was fallen from any vehicle), both the Lemmings and Grizzy try to claim them for their own. However at the end of every episode both of them accidently finds a bad ending as victims of their own schemes.<br><br>
    <h1>Characters</h1><br>
    Main
    Grizzy – Grizzy (voiced by Pierre-Alain de Garrigues [fr])[6] is an anthropormorphic bear who has a brown body and light brown fat tummy, lives in a Forest Ranger's cabin. He is approx. 7-feet tall in height and wears a green coloured locket, which belonged to the Forest Ranger. In the cabin he does not do anything except sleeping on Sofa, watching TV or eating Salmon with Yummy XL ( chocolate spread, a ripoff of Nutella ) . He likes watching TV programmes about Salmon. He does not like Opera music which sometimes, unexpectedly starts while changing channels. The only thing that stands in his way of luxury are the Lemmings, who cause him a lot of trouble and mischief. Grizzy does not like them or to share anything with them. In one episode "Intensive Care" it is shown that when the Lemmings get sick, it develops a little care in the Bear's mind. He does not say anything meaningful but he was seen reading English from a mobile phone screen. Grizzy is actually very smart and intelligent to find the solution of any situation.
    Lemmings – The Lemmings (voiced by Josselin Charier)[6] are a group of anthropomorphic lemmings with blue bodies and light blue-grey tummies, also living in the Forest Ranger's cabin. All of them have the same body shape, same height, same colour, same behaviour and same habits. Their motto is "Fun for all and All for fun!". They love having rave parties and they also eat Yummy XL like Grizzy. They love watching a TV programme about a cat and a mouse. They can sing lullaby which has made Grizzy to sleep. They also love to dance to music, which is not liked by Grizzy. They also does not likes to share anything with Grizzy. They do not say anything meaningful but often make a sound like Tabodi. While they cause a lot of chaos, their mischief is mainly targeted at Grizzy. They are not very smart or intelligent like Grizzy as shown in many episodes like in "Intensive Care" they does not know how to give care, but in some episodes they are also seen to be smart.
    Minor
    She – Bear – She is the Female anthropomorphic Grizzly bear who is Grizzy's love interest. Her colour and height is same as Grizzy but she had a heart-shaped spot on her belly. In Season 2, she received a redesign, giving her a huge pink spot ( like Grizzy's ) on her belly, instead of the former heart-shaped spot. She always has a flower in her hair like a bow. She lives in the forest and loves sniffing flowers, watching butterflies and kites. She sleeps at night on a log of wood in the forest. Grizzy always tries to impress her, but this always ends in disaster ( sometimes due to Lemmings also ). She has very little interest in Grizzy and always treats his advances with skepticism due to how he continually messes things up. She also likes popcorn. In the episode "Babysitting" it is shown that she has a female baby cub ( She-Bear Kid ) which she gives to Grizzy to babysit for some time. She-Bear has featured a larger role with main characters in the episode "Mind in a Whirl". She is called Chi-Peher in Funglish.
    Other creatures – There are also some other animals, birds and insects in the forest but they were not anthropomorphic like Grizzy, Lemmings and Female bear. They don't do anything like three of them and live in the forest like real and simple animals. Both Grizzy and the Lemmings tend to use these animals for their own schemes, but usually by the end of every episode, both of them suffer from the hilarious consequences of their actions. Sometimes other living organisms also get caught up in these troubles.
    Moose – Many Moosees appears in many episodes of the show. The Lemmings use them for transport ( and sometimes Grizzy ). Moose is fond of eating carrots. So sometimes lemmings hangs a carrot in front of his eyes to make him run. But he can eat other things like glass bottles or a ring as shown in "Bear Luck" and "Clean Bear". They are incredibly passive and don't do anything apart from graze. The colour of Mooses are mostly brown but a Black coloured Moose is shown in the episodes "A midsummer's Bear Dream" and in "Wandering Spirits". A Moose is featured in a larger role with Grizzy and Lemmings in the episode "Rainbow Moose".
    Partridge – These dumb partridge birds are often used as a mode of transport by the Lemmings. Grizzy also use them in many situations. They have big eyes and the color of their feathers are brown and black. Sometimes a partridge becomes bigger in size due to the actions and consequences of grizzy and the lemmings. A giant partridge is shown in the episodes "A Midsummer's Bear dream" , "Timeless Bear" and "The Bear Next Door" ( not in main background but another place ). In the show, the partridges fly in the sky. They are largely featured with Grizzy and the lemmings in the episodes "A Sizeable Problem" and "Call of the Bear".
